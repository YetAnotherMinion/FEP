#Finite Elements Programming
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/YetAnotherMinion/FEP.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/YetAnotherMinion/FEP) 


# Introduction

This repository contains four example applications written using [Parallel Unstructured Mesh Infrastructure](https://github.com/SCOREC/core) finite elements framework. Applications increase in complexity from a hello world program in `a1` to a full 2D PDE boundary value solver in `a4`.


# Test
